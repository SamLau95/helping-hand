## The Problem
Lots of nonprofits. Lots of people who need their services. No one place to look for help.

## The Solution
First, keep it simple. People are looking for help -- help is what they should get.

Second, make it local. People need to know what is most readily available.

Finally, make it fast. Search and view non-profits instantly from the search bar. As a non-profit, create a page in a few clicks.
